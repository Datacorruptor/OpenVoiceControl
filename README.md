# Voice Control

## Overview
A voice-activated assistant that:
1. Listens for trigger words from `triggerwords.txt`
2. Processes follow-up commands from `commands.txt`
3. Executes corresponding system commands
4. Supports dynamic arguments in commands

## Setup Guide
1. Clone this repo
2. Download [faster whisper](https://huggingface.co/Systran) models
3. Place in `models/[model_size]`
4. Configure your:
   - `triggerwords.txt`
   - `commands.txt`
   - `config.txt`
5. run `main.py`

## How to Use
1. Speak any trigger word
2. Program will listen for a command
3. If command is found programm will match it against `commands.txt`
4. And then programm will execute corresponding system command

## File Specifications

### triggerwords.txt
- **Format**: Comma-separated phrases
- **Example**:
```
voice control,voicecontrol,voices control,voicescontrol
```
### commands.txt
- **Format**: `activation_phrase::system_command`
- **Arguments**: Use `@1`, `@2`, etc.
- **Examples**:
```
open calculator::calc
```
```
google @1 in the browser::python open_url.py "https://www.google.com/search?q=@1"
```

- **additional notes on command creation**:
   - No duplicate activation phrases
   - No command that's a substring of another
   - Arguments must be separated by text
   - Phrase cannot end with argument
   - Unique text before first argument

| `chunk_size_seconds`       | any float      | Audio chunk size for processing, the bigger the longer activation phrases could be |
| `overlap_size_seconds`     | any float ( < than chunk_size_seconds/2 )                       | Relative overlap between audio chunks |

| `push_to_talk` | `True`/`False`                       | Enable push-to-talk (programm will react only if you are pressing the `push_to_talk_button`) |
| `push_to_talk_button` | key or combination of keys separated by +                        | if pressed programm will react to audio (only if `push_to_talk` is set to true) |


## Troubleshooting
- Check microphone settings/permissions
- Verify model files exist
- Enable debug prints
- Check file formatting
